Currently I'm working on a few projects:

1. [docker-forge-server](https://github.com/floridaman7588/docker-forge-server), self explainitory isn't it. A Minecraft Forge server in a Docker container.
2. [docker-bungeecord](https://github.com/floridaman7588/docker-bungeecord), the less than actively maintained brother of #1. It's a Minecraft Bungeecord server in a Docker container.
3. I'm currently, actually working on a reddit bot similar to u/B0tRank, but for human image transcribers. These are the only public details avaliable currently, and the code will not be open-sourced for a few months. (This will not be released for the foreseeable future)
4. [pihole-webhook](https://github.com/floridaman7588/pihole-webhook), a simple webserver to process HTTP requests for blocking domains and regular expressions on a PiHole server.
5. This website! Yeah, that's all.

That's it, I'm not working on much else. I am still working on learning other languages which means more things soon. Otherwise, that's it.
