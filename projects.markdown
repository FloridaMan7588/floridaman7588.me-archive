Currently I'm working on a few projects:

1. [waterfox-flatpak]({{url}}/waterfox-flatpak), a build of the Waterfox browser in a Flatpak, because the Waterfox team doesn't provide an official one.
2. [nextcloud-nginx](https://github.com/floridaman7588/docker-nc-nginx) A build of Nextcloud using Nginx and PHP8.1 running in Docker.
3. This website! Yeah, that's all.

That's it, I'm not working on much else. I am still working on learning other languages which means more things soon. Otherwise, that's it.

# Archived/Deperacated

Believe or not, I have a life outside of code, and these projects slipped through the cracks and out of my hands. I have no time to maintain them, so I just won't.

1. [docker-forge-server](https://github.com/floridaman7588/docker-forge-server)
2. [docker-bungeecord](https://github.com/floridaman7588/docker-bungeecord)
<!-- 1. I'm currently working on a reddit bot similar to u/B0tRank, but for human image transcribers. These are the only public details avaliable currently, and the code will not be open-sourced for a few months. (This will not be released for the foreseeable future) -->

# The Backburner™

Similarly to the prior section, I don't have time for some things. Not only that, but I no longer daily drive a MacBook and iPhone, so my iPhone projects are out of the window. You can still access them below, but they are 'Backburnered' so I won't be updating them. 

1. [Cydia Repo]({{url}}/cydia) Basically never did anyhting with this anyways lol
2. [Beta Cydia Repo]({{url}}/beta) Same as above, never did anything with this
3. [AltJB]({{url}}/altjb) Though I did publish this, most of these tools are now outdated. I will go through and update them eventually, but this is on The Backburner™
4. [pihole-webhook](https://github.com/floridaman7588/pihole-webhook) This was practically pointless, though some might find use out of it.
