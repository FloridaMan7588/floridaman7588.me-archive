Looks like you've found the beta repository, congratulations! You may have stumbled across this by accident, or just clikced the link on the main repo page. Well either way, your here now. So, what is this place anyway. Well it's exactly how it sounds, an APT repository for Cydia. It has my iOS tweaks that may still be in beta, or the public ones at least. Now let's get to adding this thing. 

Now this is fairly similar to the main repository in that it's exactly the same, adding it anyways. So let's first add it the easy way. 
* [Add to Cydia](cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)
* [Add to Sileo](zbra://sources/add/https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)
* [Add to Zebra](sileo://source/add/https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)
* [Add to Installer](installer://add/https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)

If that doesn't work for you, try manually adding it.
1. Open Cydia or your preferred package manager
2. Tap the *Sources* tab
3. Tap the *Edit* button
4. Tap the *Add* button
5. Type **https://floridaman7588.me/cydia**
6. Tap *Add Source*
7. And we're done

Great! Now you have my public beta APT repository for iOS devices.
