I’ve once again emerged to bring you updates as to what I am doing. You may have noticed very little of anything from me, but that is to be expected with school and a recently acquired position at a local lawn company taking most of my time from me. I have recently been on a school break and was able to get a bit of work in on some projects, such as yet again redefining my home-labs infrastructure and some other fun things soon to come. One such thing is a PiHole HTTP Webhook thing. I don’t know what to call it and I’m also not quite sure Webhook is the correct word, but it’s what I’ll be going with for the foreseeable future. The source for this software is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/floridaman7588/pihole-webhook&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with documentation available as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also working on a couple other things, the main one being a project I started a while ago and haven’t introduced yet. This project is….. A Self-Hosted Certificate Authority! I know, I know, you probably already have some solution for HTTPS at home, but this is a simplified version of whatever solution you may run. Currently it is extremely-beta, with barely any functionality besides a couple of core things. I wasn’t planning on introducing it until more was done but who cares really. I will elaborate in further posts and updates but the basic concept is that it issues SSL certificates with a self-signed root certificate. The only difference between my tool and using the CLI or something is that it is managed via a WebUI and not a text interface such as the CLI. It’s just meant to simplify the experience so that beginners and experienced users alike can use SSL on their local services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more for me to talk about but that will probably end up in a post further down the line. It’s getting a bit late for me so I will probably be heading to bed here shortly and won’t continue writing. That’s all from me for now folks, remember to look out for further posts and updates, and I’ll see ya round. Bye!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>FloridaMan</name></author><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html">Hello yet again! I’ve once again emerged to bring you updates as to what I am doing.

I’m actually doing something too. Right now the thing that I’m doing is a write-up for a YouTube video that I made like half a year ago.
Yeah. Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-we-get-started&quot;&gt;Before we get started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started I need to clarify that my video uses a now outdated script for deploying Home Assistant Supervised, so in this write-up we will be using
the updated version. I also need to say that this tutorial was originally made on a VMware amd64 virtual machine, but it should work on a bare metal host. Now the lsdt thing I have to say is that this install script is for Debian 10 buster but I believe it should work on other flavours of linux as well. Please correct me if I’m wrong. Alright let’s get started now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-installing-dependencies&quot;&gt;Step 1, installing dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is assuming that you are runnng Debian 10 Buster (and derivatives) or Debian 11 Bullseye (and derivatives). The first thing we need to do is update
our apt package lists so that we can download everything properly. We can do this by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt upgrade -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to update any packages that need to be. Then we are going to install our dependencies with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt install -y software-properties-common apparmor-utils apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl dbus jq network-manager&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds the necessary software to our system for Docker to properley run our containers. We also need to disable the ModemManager service for everything to work properly. We can do this by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl disable ModemManager&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and stop it by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl stop ModemManager&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-11-installing-docker&quot;&gt;Step 1.1, Installing Docker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install Docker, we will downlod and run the convenience script from the Docker website by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sudo sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this should completley download and install docker without much of any use interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-install-home-assistant&quot;&gt;Step 2, Install Home Assistant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install Home Assistant we are going to simply clone and run the Home Assistant Supervised install script from GitHub by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl -Lo installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer/master/installer.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and running the script simple by using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo bash installer.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that should do it. Just sit back and let the installer do it’s thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-onboarding&quot;&gt;Step 3, Onboarding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point Home Assitant should be installed and the install script should have spit out an ip for you to connect to. For instance my video shows 192.168.81.128 at port 8123. Since I was using a GUI I was just able to connect to localhost instead, but you are probably installing in a headless environment so you NEED to connect to your devices hostname/local ip address. At this point you should see something like this: &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/docker/home-assistant-onboarding.png&quot; alt=&quot;home-assistant-onboarding.png&quot; title=&quot;home-assistant-onboarding.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your here, your golden. You can complete the setup by following the instructions and you’ll have it completley set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, congratulations! You’ve succesfully deployed an entire network of Docker container for running your smart home. Great job! This was a rather simple process but when I was first starting out these kind of articles were huge helps, so I hope this one will help you. Have a good rest of your day/night/whatever, and goodbye!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>FloridaMan</name></author><category term="Docker" /><category term="Home Assistant" /><category term="Tutorial" /><summary type="html">Hey, it’s me again!

I’ve been busy with school and everything but I’m sure chugging along here. I was busy working with some docker compose scripts and such a while back working with my smart home but otherwise I haven’t been doing much. I’ve tried to get some work done on the docker things and my (hopefully) coming soon reddit bot, but I just haven’t had much time. You can try to expect more from me, but you never know. The website is pretty much finished, I’ve only got a few housekeeping things to work on (commenting, RSS, EMail feed, etc.) so there probably won’t be much else to see for a while. I will try and get at least the bungeecord container updated for the latest version of Minecraft &amp;amp; Bungeecord, but that’s probably about it for a while. I am getting pretty tired, so I think I’m going to sign off for now.

If you are reading this, cool. I’ve been working on my website here and I’ve added a couple pages, as well as some other special little things around the place. You may notice the ‘Cydia’ and ‘AltStore Source’ tabs at the top appearing. Those are pretty self-explanatory to most people that my audience consists of. If you don’t understand what they are, clicking on them probably won’t help either unfortunatley. The are what they say they are. But anyways anyways, these new pages aren’t just pages. They allow direct access to what each one states that it might be. Have a look, and a few clicks around. You might find yourself adding my AltSource through a link or two (Hint, Hint). Yeah that’s really about it, I’m hoping to purchase a domain name soon so that this website will be nice and proper. Once that happens this site will probably be near completion anyways.

Though I am kind of cheating as I’m using Jekyll to make this. Anyways, let’s talk about this 
here new website. As I’ve stated, I am using Jekyll to make this site so It’s a bit easier on me. This website is going to be a general blogging/tutorial/whatever 
website for me to post about my projects and other things I do in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am doing other things in my time currently (ex. spending time with the other humans), but I will be working on more projects sooner or later. I haven’t
published a new YouTube video lately so I intend on doing some more of those eventually. I plan on learning some more programming languages over the summer period. I will be working on C and Swift in particualr, but I may change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some projects I’ve been working on lately are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning Ansible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working on my Docker skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning the aforementioned launguages (C and Swift)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can expect more to come from me in relation to these things. I am attemping to whip up an Ansible playbook to install Docker on any computer so look forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’ve got some more work to do here so I am going to end this blog post update thing here. See y’all later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>FloridaMan</name></author><category term="News" /><category term="Website" /><summary type="html">Finally, a new website that isn’t totally stolen from someone else.
