That means there is a very slim chance that you are reading this unless I know you personally. If you are reading this, cool. I’ve been working on my website here and I’ve added a couple pages, as well as some other special little things around the place. You may notice the ‘Cydia’ and ‘AltStore Source’ tabs at the top appearing. Those are pretty self-explanatory to most people that my audience consists of. If you don’t understand what they are, clicking on them probably won’t help either unfortunatley. The are what they say they are. But anyways anyways, these new pages aren’t just pages. They allow direct access to what each one states that it might be. Have a look, and a few clicks around. You might find yourself adding my AltSource through a link or two (Hint, Hint). Yeah that’s really about it, I’m hoping to purchase a domain name soon so that this website will be nice and proper. Once that happens this site will probably be near completion anyways. Check back soon for more details and updates, hope to see you.\n",

        "title": "Home Assistant Supervised on Docker",
        "excerpt": "Hey, it’s me again! I’m actually doing something too. Right now the thing that I’m doing is a write-up for a YouTube video that I made like half a year ago.\nYeah. Let’s get started.\n\nBefore we get started\n\nBefore we get started I need to clarify that my video uses a now outdated script for deploying Home Assistant Supervised, so in this write-up we will be using\nthe updated version. I also need to say that this tutorial was originally made on a VMware amd64 virtual machine, but it should work on a bare metal host. Now the lsdt thing I have to say is that this install script is for Debian 10 buster but I believe it should work on other flavours of linux as well. Please correct me if I’m wrong. Alright let’s get started now.\n\nStep 1, installing dependencies\n\nThis tutorial is assuming that you are runnng Debian 10 Buster (and derivatives) or Debian 11 Bullseye (and derivatives). The first thing we need to do is update\nour apt package lists so that we can download everything properly. We can do this by running\n\nsudo apt update\n\nand then running\n\nsudo apt upgrade -y\n\nto update any packages that need to be. Then we are going to install our dependencies with\n\nsudo apt install -y software-properties-common apparmor-utils apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl dbus jq network-manager\n\nThis adds the necessary software to our system for Docker to properley run our containers. We also need to disable the ModemManager service for everything to work properly. We can do this by running\n\nsudo systemctl disable ModemManager\n\nand stop it by running\n\nsudo systemctl stop ModemManager\n\nStep 1.1, Installing Docker\n\nTo install Docker, we will downlod and run the convenience script from the Docker website by running\n\ncurl -fsSL get.docker.com | sudo sh\n\nthis should completley download and install docker without much of any use interaction.\n\nStep 2, Install Home Assistant\n\nTo install Home Assistant we are going to simply clone and run the Home Assistant Supervised install script from GitHub by running\n\ncurl -Lo installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer/master/installer.sh\n\nand running the script simple by using\n\nsudo bash installer.sh\n\nand that should do it. Just sit back and let the installer do it’s thing.\n\nStep 3, Onboarding\n\nAt this point Home Assitant should be installed and the install script should have spit out an ip for you to connect to. For instance my video shows 192.168.81.128 at port 8123. Since I was using a GUI I was just able to connect to localhost instead, but you are probably installing in a headless environment so you NEED to connect to your devices hostname/local ip address. At this point you should see something like this: \n\nOnce your here, your golden. You can complete the setup by following the instructions and you’ll have it completley set up.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nWell, congratulations! You’ve succesfully deployed an entire network of Docker container for running your smart home. Great job! This was a rather simple process but when I was first starting out these kind of articles were huge helps, so I hope this one will help you. Have a good rest of your day/night/whatever, and goodbye!\n",

You may have noticed very little of anything from me, but that is to be expected with school and a recently acquired position at a local lawn company taking most of my time from me. I have recently been on a school break and was able to get a bit of work in on some projects, such as yet again redefining my home-labs infrastructure and some other fun things soon to come. One such thing is a PiHole HTTP Webhook thing. I don’t know what to call it and I’m also not quite sure Webhook is the correct word, but it’s what I’ll be going with for the foreseeable future. The source for this software is available here, with documentation available as well.\n\nI am also working on a couple other things, the main one being a project I started a while ago and haven’t introduced yet. This project is….. A Self-Hosted Certificate Authority! I know, I know, you probably already have some solution for HTTPS at home, but this is a simplified version of whatever solution you may run. Currently it is extremely-beta, with barely any functionality besides a couple of core things. I wasn’t planning on introducing it until more was done but who cares really. I will elaborate in further posts and updates but the basic concept is that it issues SSL certificates with a self-signed root certificate. The only difference between my tool and using the CLI or something is that it is managed via a WebUI and not a text interface such as the CLI. It’s just meant to simplify the experience so that beginners and experienced users alike can use SSL on their local services.\n\nThere is more for me to talk about but that will probably end up in a post further down the line. It’s getting a bit late for me so I will probably be heading to bed here shortly and won’t continue writing. That’s all from me for now folks, remember to look out for further posts and updates, and I’ll see ya round. Bye!\n",

Remember when I Tweeted saying I would upload a video in a week and then went radio silent for a few months, yeah me neither. I wonder if that’s because it was nearly 7 months ago or if I just have a bad memory. Well yeah I know it’s weird that I come back now but I have my reasons. For example, I’ve been in school the whole time, and though I’m not even in high school, I’ve still been extremely busy. Not only have I been in school, but I’ve had many different personal things going on, not allowing for much time to work on my projects. Now that it’s summer time, I’ve got all the time that I need to work on my projects.\n\nAs for those projects, I had decided, during the period of which I had no time, that I will scrap or at least Backburner™ some projects, including my iOS related projects. These include that one Reddit bot I was going to make, my Cydia repository(s), and some other stuff. Now I will continue to work on this website of course, as well as my waterfox-flatpak project, and potentially my ca-server or EasyCA project too. I will continue to be active over my summer break, or at least try to be, and I will continue to update some of my projects.\n\nI did make many changes and updates to this website as well, including fixing mobile support and removing some of those deprecated or archived projects from the navigation bar. You can still access the pages for those projects through the projects tab, but they are most likely unsupported by me. I also added official support for RSS and a proper sitemap file. As for the end user experience, I added pagination and some sharing options as supported by the Alembic Jekyll theme that I use to build this site. I also created a privacy policy, and credited the original author of the theme on the footer. Thats about it in terms of site upgrades, or at least uodates of things that you might notice.\n\nI also intend on streaming quite a bit, and I spent like a day setting up my OBS so I plan not to let that go to waste. You should know where to find me by now, but if you don’t, all my social links can be found at https://fm7588.me/links. I will be streaming on both YouTube and Twitch, and I will stream on multiple YouTube accounts for different reasons (My primary YouTube for code stuff, and my secondary for games). I still need to add my secondary YouTube channel to my link page, but that issue should be resolved by the time this is published.\n\nThat’s about it really, I ought to head off to bed now shouldn’t I.

    "content": "Hey! I have an APT repository for jailbroken iOS devices, yay! Yeah that’s cool and all, but what’s on it and how do I add it. Well I don’t know Swift, or objective-c for that matter. That means there is nothing on my repository, wooo! Yeah, I know. I thought it would be fun to set one up, and when the day comes that I actually can develop iOS tweaks, it will come in handy. Now let’s get on with the ‘how do I add it’ part.\n\nAlright, let’s do this. We can do this two ways, the easy way and the hard way. First will try the easy way, you can just tap the buttons below to add my repository to your preferred package manager.\n\n  Add to Cydia\n  Add to Sileo\n  Add to Zebra\n  Add to Installer\n\n\nNow here’s the hard way\n\n  Open Cydia or your preferred package manager\n  Tap the Sources tab\n  Tap the Edit button\n  Tap the Add button\n  Type https://floridaman7588.me/cydia\n  Tap Add Source\n  And we’re done\n\n\nThat’s it, you’ve added my APT repository, as empty as it is\n\nPsst looking for something else? You can find the beta repository here\n",

Yeah, that’s all.\n\n\nThat’s it, I’m not working on much else. I am still working on learning other languages which means more things soon. Otherwise, that’s it.\n\nArchived/Deperacated\n\nBelieve or not, I have a life outside of code, and these projects slipped through the cracks and out of my hands. I have no time to maintain them, so I just won’t.\n\n\n  docker-forge-server\n  docker-bungeecord\n\n\n\nThe Backburner™\n\nSimilarly to the prior section, I don’t have time for some things. Not only that, but I no longer daily drive a MacBook and iPhone, so my iPhone projects are out of the window. You can still access them below, but they are ‘Backburnered’ so I won’t be updating them.\n\n\n  Cydia Repo Basically never did anyhting with this anyways lol\n  Beta Cydia Repo Same as above, never did anything with this\n  AltJB Though I did publish this, most of these tools are now outdated. I will go through and update them eventually, but this is on The Backburner™\n\n",
