AltStore eh, yep we're doing that now. AltStore is a really neat tool, allowing you to sideload apps on-device. Pretty cool, but what do I have to do with it. Well the alpha version of AltStore allows you to add sources from third parties for other apps, right? So I went to myself and said "That's pretty cool, I'm gonna make one", and so I did. It doesn't host my apps, but tools for jailbreaking and other dev applications. Apps like Unc0ver, Odyssey, Taurine, and PlankFilza are all there. Like I said, not my apps. You can add the source in the following ways; 
The easy way
* [Add the source here](altstore://source?url=https://floridaman7588.me/altjb/altsource.json)

The less-easy way
1. Open AltStore (Alpha version)
2. Select the *Browse* tab
3. Select the *Sources* button
4. Select the *+* button
5. Enter **https://floridaman7588.me/altjb/altsource.json**

And now we're done, you've added the source and can download jailbreaks and dev tools right from AltStore
