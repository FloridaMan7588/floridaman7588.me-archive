Hey! I have an APT repository for jailbroken iOS devices, yay! Yeah that's cool and all, but what's on it and how do I add it. Well I don't know Swift, or objective-c for that matter. That means there is nothing on my repository, wooo! Yeah, I know. I thought it would be fun to set one up, and when the day comes that I actually *can* develop iOS tweaks, it will come in handy. Now let's get on with the 'how do I add it' part.

Alright, let's do this. We can do this two ways, the easy way and the hard way. First will try the easy way, you can just tap the buttons below to add my repository to your preferred package manager.
* [Add to Cydia](cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)
* [Add to Sileo](zbra://sources/add/https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)
* [Add to Zebra](sileo://source/add/https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)
* [Add to Installer](installer://add/https://floridaman7588.me/cydia)

Now here's the hard way 
1. Open Cydia or your preferred package manager
2. Tap the *Sources* tab
3. Tap the *Edit* button
4. Tap the *Add* button
5. Type **https://floridaman7588.me/cydia**
6. Tap *Add Source*
7. And we're done

That's it, you've added my APT repository, as empty as it is
