# Hello!
Welcome to my site! This is still very much a work in progress, but you can feel free to have a look around. I will continue to work on this site every once and a while but right now I'm busy with school so updates may be few and far between. Look out for blog posts too, those may happen sometimes. I'm working on some projects right now like learning Swift, and writing a reddit bot so look out for that. Anyway, there is lot's more for me to be doing so I best get to it.
