## About Me

Hi! I'm FloridaMan, I'm a person who does things in a place. I wrote a code or two, and I can make computers do things. I mainly write JavaScript but I have been working with bash scripts and docker lately. I am also working on my Anisble skills and intend on learning C and Swift. You can find some of my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/floridaman7588).

## About the site

So, you want to know about the site too, huh? Well let's talk about it. This site runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with the [Alembic theme](https://alembic.darn.es) and some [custom layouts](https://github.com/FloridaMan7588/alembic-custom-layouts). Commenting on each post is handled by [Disqus](https://disqus.com), and RSS/EMail feeds are (soon to be) handled by [SimpleForm](https://getsimpleform.com). Whew, that's a lot of links. That is about it though, so make sure to check out these things.
