So I made a thing. See I like Waterfox, it's a good browser, the only thing I don't like is how it's installed (on Linux at least). The Waterfox team provides an archive with all of Waterfox's libraries and it's precompiled binary file. I'm not personally a big fan of integrating everything into my desktop manually, so I made a Flatpak. This project probably took a lot longer than it would simply integrating it into my desktop manually, but maybe I'll help someone in the process. For now, you can download it from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/FloridaMan7588/waterfox-flatpak/releases/tag/g4-v1.0.0), but I'm working on making a Flatpak repository as well. Of course, I didn't make Waterfox and I didn't even make the basis of this project (though I've changed it a lot), so a lot of credit goes out to the [Waterfox Team](https://waterfox.net) and [Xhorak](https://github.com/xhorak/firefox-devedition-flatpak). Of course the Waterfox team being responsible for the Waterfox project, and Xhorak for making what was the basis for this project
